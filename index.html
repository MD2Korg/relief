						<li>
							<h3>General Info</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is the purpose of the  study?</h4>
									<p>The purpose of the Mobile Open Observation of Daily Stressors (RELIEF) study is to understand what causes stress (i.e., what are the daily stressors) in daily life, focusing on those stress events that can be detected by smartwatches.</p>

									<h4>Who can join the RELIEF study?</h4>
									<p>Any adult (18+) residing in the United States who meets the eligibility criteria for the study (<a href="#participate">criteria</a>) can apply to participate in the RELIEF study.</p>

									<h4>How long is the RELIEF study for?</h4>
									<p>Each participant is asked to participate in the study for 100 days, using the RELIEF app daily, wearing the study-provided smartwatch, and completing weekly app-based surveys. Participants will receive weekly visualizations of their data, showing patterns of their daily stressors.</p>


								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is the mDOT Center of Excellence?</h4>
									<p>The mHealth Center for Discovery, Optimization & Translation of Temporally-Precise Interventions (the mDOT Center) provides the methods, tools, and infrastructure for researchers to discover, optimize and deploy temporally-precise mHealth interventions to address growing public health problems.
									</p>

									<h4>Can I continue in the RELIEF study beyond the required 100 days?</h4>
									<p>Yes, while the study is still ongoing. Once the study concludes, you will be notified that the RELIEF study and apps will be shut down, and you should uninstall the RELIEF app from both the smartwatch and your phone. If you continue using the apps after the study has concluded, the apps' functionality may stop working.</p>

									<h4>Can I keep the smartwatch when/if I complete the full study?</h4>
									<p>Yes, if you fulfill all requirements and complete the study. A full description of study requirements is located in the study’s informed consent document.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>CuesHub App</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>How do I install the app?</h4>
									<p>Please download the CuesHub app from the App Store (iOS) or the Play Store (Android).
										Visit this <a href="https://www.cueshub.com/apps" target="_blank">CuesHub</a> link for detailed app installation information.
										</p>

									<h4>How do I use the app?</h4>
									<p>You will receive prompts on your smartphone and smartwatch (if applicable) throughout the day. You will use the CuesHub app on your smartphone to log and rate your events.
										For events where you want to receive an intervention, click the second icon at the top right of the app screen and share the event details to the study email: reliefmdot@gmail.com</p>

									
									<h4>How do I share the weekly memory?</h4>
										<p>You will receive prompts on your smartphone and smartwatch (if applicable) throughout the day. You will use the CuesHub app on your smartphone to log and rate your events.
											For events where you want to receive an intervention, click the second icon at the top right of the app screen and share the event details to the study email: reliefmdot@gmail.com</p>
										</div>
									<div class="content">
									<h4>Does the CuesHub app use my cellular data?</h4>
									<p>Yes. The app sends a small amount of data to the server for the purposes of logging  events on the server. Data rates may apply to use the app depending on your cellular plan.</p>

									<h4>Can I come back later to the app for annotating the episodes?</h4>
									<p>Yes. Although we recommend the annotation process be done once you open the app after you receive the notifications. This helps us to ensure that you are annotating your most recent recollection of the stress event(s).</p>

									<h4>What do I enter in the app if I am not able to recall the stressor?</h4>
									<p>You can type in "Can't recall", but this will limit your ability to see the patterns in different stressors because these episodes may not be included in your data analysis.</p>

									


									<h4>Can I use my own smartwatch for the RELIEF study?</h4>
									<p>Yes, if your smartwatch supports CuesHub app, you can use your own smartwatch for the RELIEF study.</p>

									</div>

														
								
							</div>
						</li>
						

						<li>
							<h3>Interventions</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>How are the interventions delivered?</h4>
									<p>After you share your stressor via CuesHub app, you will receive interventions via email within a few hours of sharing your stressor events.
										Each intervention email will include a Qualtrics link to rate the intervention you received.
										Please review the interventions carefully and complete the feedback survey using the provided link.
										</p>

										<h4>How are the interventions generated?</h4>
										<p>We use state of art Large Language Models to generate interventions.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="content">
											<h4>What information are used for generating interventions</h4>
										<p>We only use your shared stressors and locations to generate interventions. However, we strongly encourage you not to use any  sensitive personal details like specific names or locations (like an address) when you are reporting your stress.
											</p>

										</div>

								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What data does the RELIEF study collect?</h4>
									<p>The RELIEF app only collects the stressor and location data shared by you through CuesHub app. This information is then used to generate interventions which will be delivered to you via emails.</p>

								

									<h4>Who will have access to the collected data?</h4>
									<p>Authorized researchers working with the study team will have access to the data. We also plan to publicly release the de-identified dataset to the research community, i.e., the released dataset will not contain any identifying information such as your personal information.</p>

									<h4>What purposes will the data be used for?</h4>
									<p>We will only use your contact information for the purposes of contacting you about this research study, and future research studies if you choose. We will use your research data for scientific progress and for the publication of study results. Please refer to the informed consent document for more information about data usage and sharing.</p>

							</div>
						</li>


						<li>
							<h3>Privacy</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>Does the RELIEF study collect and/or share personally identifying information?</h4>
									<p>We need your identifiable contact information such as name, and email address in order to send the interventions and weekly survey. We may also correspond with you, and you may ask us questions via email to ensure the study data collection is running smoothly. This identifying information is not shared with anyone outside the study team and is also not released or shared with any of the study data for research purposes.</p>

									<p>We <b>do not collect your GPS location</b> when you share your stressors to the study. We will only share de-identified semantic locations (non-identifiable labels like “home” or “workplace”) when these data are shared more broadly.</p>

					

									<p>More detailed information about study privacy and confidentiality is located in this study’s informed consent document.</p>
