						<h1>MOODS Privacy Notice</h1>
						<p>Last updated and effective as of May 18, 2021.</p>
					</header>
					<p>The Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge at the University of Memphis (MD2K, we, us, or our) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information we collect, use, share, and otherwise process. We also believe in transparency and are committed to informing you about how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process your information when you use our Platform.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. IF THERE ARE TERMS IN THIS POLICY THAT YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE PLATFORM AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
IN THE EVENT OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, PLEASE CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE PLATFORM IS INTENDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN THE DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT OF DISEASES OR OTHER CONDITIONS. WE DO NOT AND CANNOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE. NO CONTENT PROVIDED IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL ADVICE. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PRIOR TO MAKING ANY DECISIONS RELATED TO YOUR HEALTH.
THE PLATFORM IS INTENDED FOR USERS 18 AND OVER AND RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PLATFORM IS NOT TO BE USED BY RESIDENTS OF OTHER LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only when you use the Platform. It does not apply to other interactions with MD2K or the University of Memphis.<p>
<p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy. We will alert you about changes by updating the “Last updated and effective as of” date and by displaying on the Website, for 30 days after changes are made, a notice stating that the Privacy Policy has been updated. You will not receive specific notice of each change. It is your responsibility to periodically review the Website and this Privacy Policy. You are subject to the changes by continued use of the Platform.</p>


					<h4>ABOUT THE PLATFORM </h4>
					<p>The Platform is the online service and mobile application offered by MD2K. It includes the MOODS study applications for smartphone and smartwatch (Study Apps) and associated websites (moods.md2k.org) (Website), together with any associated software applications, database structures and queries, interfaces, tools, and the like, together with any and all revisions, modifications, and updates thereof as made available by MD2K.</p>
					<p>The Platform was developed by MD2K as part of an ongoing research study.</p>

					<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How does the MOODS applications work?</span></strong> When you download and launch the Mobile App onto your smartphone, the Mobile App will ask you for a code before you can proceed to the consent process within the app. This code will be provided to you upon completing the study screening form and being selected to participate in the study. Additional information about the screening process is located here <a href="https://moods.md2k.org/pdfs/MOODS_consent.pdf">https://moods.md2k.org/pdfs/MOODS_consent.pdf</a>. Once you are enrolled in the study, a Study ID will be generated to identify you in the study without using your identifiable contact information. Once you receive the study smartwatch, you will load a separate Smartwatch Application onto the smartwatch and pair it to the Study app on the phone to begin collecting data about your stress and physiology. This information will be assigned to your Study ID and will connect with the Mobile App (e.g., so you can annotate stress episodes) for the study’s data collection. Information from the Study Apps will sync with our servers periodically throughout the day. Additional information about the data collected by the smartwatch is located in the study’s informed consent document.</p>
					<p>Throughout the day, the Study Apps will periodically track your device’s movements and record time-stamped GPS data about your device’s location when stress events are detected, even when the Mobile App is not open. The location and time data will be assigned to your Study ID. We will keep this information separate from your contact information when sharing these data for research, though the internal study team may use your contact information to contact you for study support or operations purposes. For example, we may ask if you are still participating in the study if we do not hear from you and stop receiving study data from you.</p>
					<p>The information collected from you for the MOODS study will be collected on our servers, and we will use this information to send you weekly visualizations to the email address you have provided to us. You can then review the visualizations of your stress data to determine what is useful information to you. Feedback may be provided to us via email, weekly surveys sent to your Study Apps, or optional third-party tools (e.g., forums). Any use of third-party services will be governed by their own Terms of Use and Privacy Policies. Additional information about these mechanisms is located in the informed consent document.</p>
					<p>You should only use the Study Apps on one respective device (i.e., your smartphone and study-provided smartwatch), and you should not manipulate or falsify your location data. Please do not permit another individual to use your devices.</p>

					<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can the MOODS application be used by anyone?</span></strong> No. The Study Apps may only be used by residents of the United States who are at least 18 years old and who are enrolled in our MOODS study.</p>

					<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can the Platform help the community?</span></strong> The Mobile App allows users to share valuable information about their physical proximity to other Mobile App users so that we can help identify areas of social crowding (i.e., areas in which multiple people are gathered in a single location at one time).  Information about social crowding will be shared as anonymous, deidentified, or aggregated data (i.e., no one person is identified) via the Website to help determine ways to slow down or prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Social crowding maps that show user density by time of day will be accessible via the Mobile App and the Website.</p>

					<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can the Study Applications help users?</span></strong> The Study Apps provide users with information about system-detected stress events and allows users to describe the context around which those stress events take place. Weekly visualizations provided from these data may help users better understand their patterns of stress. This information is being used for research purposes to help answer research questions as described in the informed consent document. This information is not intended to be used for health, wellness, lifestyle, or any other decision-making purposes. We cannot and do not warrant the accuracy of stress events or any other collected or derived data from this study.</p>
					<p>Notifications will occur once daily via the Mobile App to annotate stress events with the context of that stress event, i.e., what caused the stress event (what was the stressor?). Notifications will also occur once weekly to assess the impact of visualizations and collect feedback on the visualizations.</p>



					<h4>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h4>
					<p>We collect and process the following information:</p>
					<table style="width:90%">
					  <tr>
					    <th>Category</th>
					    <th>Description of Data and Purposes</th>
					  </tr>
					  <tr>
					    <td>Study ID</td>
					    <td>Each account has a random Study ID generated upon the first time it registers with our systems. The Study ID is not based on your name or contact information, and we do not use this ID to try to identify you individually. We can use this Study ID to share your study data (as described in the informed consent document).</td>
					  </tr>
						<tr>
					    <td>Time Stamp and Location Data</td>
					    <td>Throughout each day, the Study Apps will track your device’s movements and record time-stamped GPS data about your device’s location when stress events are detected by the Smartwatch Application, even if the Mobile App is not open. The location and time data will be assigned to your Study ID and the location data may reveal the places that a particular Study ID spends time (e.g., home or work address), but MD2K will use this information for research – not to make any efforts to identify the user.</td>
					  </tr>
						<tr>
					    <td>Mobile Application</td>
					    <td>Additionally, the Mobile Application will be collecting your annotations of the stress events, your responses to weekly surveys, and your interactions within the Mobile App.</td>
					  </tr>
						<tr>
					    <td>Smartwatch Application</td>
					    <td>The Smartwatch Application (loaded onto your study-provided smartwatch) will be collecting information about your wrist movements, location, and heart rate via its onboard sensors. This information will be used to derive system-detected stress events.</td>
